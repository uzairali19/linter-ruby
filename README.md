# Ruby - Linter

The project is used to create a linter that can check for error messages inside a code. This check can be on any ruby file. Lint, or a linter, is a static code analysis tool used to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors and suspicious constructs. The analysis performed by lint-like tools can also be performed by an optimizing compiler, which aims to generate faster code
